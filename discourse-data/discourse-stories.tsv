"	"Maxine was a happy frog that lived in a beautiful pond by the river. She loved to play in the water and take a bath every day. But her friends, Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like to take baths. So one day when she was swimming alone, she met a new friend named Thomas. Thomas loved to take lots of baths, so he became friends with Maxine. But Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like Thomas. So one day when Maxine and Thomas were swimming, Cindy did something mean. She threw rocks at Maxine and Thomas. Maxine's dad saw what happened and he was very mad. He went over and yelled at Cindy for what she did. After that Cindy didn't throw any rocks, and Maxine and Thomas could swim together and take lots of baths. They were very happy since they could play in the water as much as they wanted without other frogs being mean to them.

"	"Maxine was a happy frog that lived in a beautiful pond by the river. She loved to play in the water and take a bath every day. But her friends, Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like to take baths. So one day when she was swimming alone, she met a new friend named Thomas. Thomas loved to take lots of baths, so he became friends with Maxine. But Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like Thomas. So one day when Maxine and Thomas were swimming, Cindy did something mean. She threw rocks at Maxine and Thomas. Maxine's dad saw what happened and he was very mad. He went over and yelled at Cindy for what she did. After that Cindy didn't throw any rocks, and Maxine and Thomas could swim together and take lots of baths. They were very happy since they could play in the water as much as they wanted without other frogs being mean to them.

"	"Maxine was a happy frog that lived in a beautiful pond by the river. She loved to play in the water and take a bath every day. But her friends, Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like to take baths. So one day when she was swimming alone, she met a new friend named Thomas. Thomas loved to take lots of baths, so he became friends with Maxine. But Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like Thomas. So one day when Maxine and Thomas were swimming, Cindy did something mean. She threw rocks at Maxine and Thomas. Maxine's dad saw what happened and he was very mad. He went over and yelled at Cindy for what she did. After that Cindy didn't throw any rocks, and Maxine and Thomas could swim together and take lots of baths. They were very happy since they could play in the water as much as they wanted without other frogs being mean to them.

"	"Will was playing his favorite song.  The song was about a flower.  Will stopped singing and went outside.  A single star was out in the night sky.  Will got hungry and went inside to get a biscuit.  He also had jam with it.  He didn't want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.  Will sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.  Will walked over to the living room.  On his way there, he put a napkin in the trashcan.  When he was in the living room, it started to rain.  It stopped raining and Will walked all the way to the store.  When at the store, Will had a good laugh at a very silly looking dog.  Will heard it start to thunder.  Will looked outside to see if it was raining again, and it was not.  Will was happy he didn't have to get wet walking home.  He went outside smiling.

"	"Will was playing his favorite song.  The song was about a flower.  Will stopped singing and went outside.  A single star was out in the night sky.  Will got hungry and went inside to get a biscuit.  He also had jam with it.  He didn't want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.  Will sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.  Will walked over to the living room.  On his way there, he put a napkin in the trashcan.  When he was in the living room, it started to rain.  It stopped raining and Will walked all the way to the store.  When at the store, Will had a good laugh at a very silly looking dog.  Will heard it start to thunder.  Will looked outside to see if it was raining again, and it was not.  Will was happy he didn't have to get wet walking home.  He went outside smiling.

"	"Alyssa got to the beach after a long trip. She's from Charlotte. She traveled from Atlanta. She's now in Miami. She went to Miami to visit some friends. But she wanted some time to herself at the beach, so she went there first. After going swimming and laying out, she went to her friend Ellen's house. Ellen greeted Alyssa and they both had some lemonade to drink. Alyssa called her friends Kristin and Rachel to meet at Ellen's house. The girls traded stories and caught up on their lives. It was a happy time for everyone. The girls went to a restaurant for dinner. The restaurant had a special on catfish. Alyssa enjoyed the restaurant's special. Ellen ordered a salad. Kristin had soup. Rachel had a steak. After eating, the ladies went back to Ellen's house to have fun. They had lots of fun. They stayed the night because they were tired. Alyssa was happy to spend time with her friends again.

"	"Alyssa got to the beach after a long trip. She's from Charlotte. She traveled from Atlanta. She's now in Miami. She went to Miami to visit some friends. But she wanted some time to herself at the beach, so she went there first. After going swimming and laying out, she went to her friend Ellen's house. Ellen greeted Alyssa and they both had some lemonade to drink. Alyssa called her friends Kristin and Rachel to meet at Ellen's house. The girls traded stories and caught up on their lives. It was a happy time for everyone. The girls went to a restaurant for dinner. The restaurant had a special on catfish. Alyssa enjoyed the restaurant's special. Ellen ordered a salad. Kristin had soup. Rachel had a steak. After eating, the ladies went back to Ellen's house to have fun. They had lots of fun. They stayed the night because they were tired. Alyssa was happy to spend time with her friends again.

"	"Kelly woke up one morning and went outside to her back yard. She was in a hurry because it was Mother's Day and she had to collect flowers before her mom woke up to give to her as a present. She was going to give her mom the biggest, most beautiful bunch of flowers her mother had ever seen. She knew where the best flowers were in her yard. She got a lot of different sized flowers. The red ones were big, the orange ones were small, and the green ones were in the middle. After Kelly collected all of the flowers, she went inside and tied them together with string. After that, she had to hide the flowers in a secret spot. She hoped her baby sister Morgan, who was still in diapers, wouldn't find the flowers and eat them. Kelly was worried, so she hid them in a new spot that was up higher. Finally, her mother woke up at 8:30 AM, and Kelly was excited! Kelly gave her mother the flowers. Her mother's favorite was the red one.

"	"Kelly woke up one morning and went outside to her back yard. She was in a hurry because it was Mother's Day and she had to collect flowers before her mom woke up to give to her as a present. She was going to give her mom the biggest, most beautiful bunch of flowers her mother had ever seen. She knew where the best flowers were in her yard. She got a lot of different sized flowers. The red ones were big, the orange ones were small, and the green ones were in the middle. After Kelly collected all of the flowers, she went inside and tied them together with string. After that, she had to hide the flowers in a secret spot. She hoped her baby sister Morgan, who was still in diapers, wouldn't find the flowers and eat them. Kelly was worried, so she hid them in a new spot that was up higher. Finally, her mother woke up at 8:30 AM, and Kelly was excited! Kelly gave her mother the flowers. Her mother's favorite was the red one.

"There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  
The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  
The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  
The lion began attacking the mouse.  
The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  
The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  
The lion began to be amused.  
The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  
Opportunity arrived.  
A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  
The lion entangled himself in the net.  
The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  
The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  
The mouse ran to the lion.  
The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  
The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  
The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.

"	"A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."""
"There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  
The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  
The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  
The lion began attacking the mouse.  
The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  
The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  
The lion began to be amused.  
The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  
Opportunity arrived.  
A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  
The lion entangled himself in the net.  
The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  
The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  
The mouse ran to the lion.  
The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  
The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  
The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.

"	"A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."""
"There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  
The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  
The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  
The lion began attacking the mouse.  
The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  
The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  
The lion began to be amused.  
The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  
Opportunity arrived.  
A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  
The lion entangled himself in the net.  
The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  
The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  
The mouse ran to the lion.  
The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  
The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  
The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.

"	"A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."""
"There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  
The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  
The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  
The lion began attacking the mouse.  
The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  
The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  
The lion began to be amused.  
The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  
Opportunity arrived.  
A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  
The lion entangled himself in the net.  
The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  
The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  
The mouse ran to the lion.  
The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  
The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  
The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.

"	"A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."""
"There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  
The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  
The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  
The lion began attacking the mouse.  
The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  
The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  
The lion began to be amused.  
The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  
Opportunity arrived.  
A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  
The lion entangled himself in the net.  
The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  
The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  
The mouse ran to the lion.  
The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  
The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  
The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.

"	"A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."""
"There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  
The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  
The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  
The lion began attacking the mouse.  
The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  
The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  
The lion began to be amused.  
The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  
Opportunity arrived.  
A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  
The lion entangled himself in the net.  
The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  
The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  
The mouse ran to the lion.  
The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  
The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  
The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.

"	"A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."""
"There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  
The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  
The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  
The lion began attacking the mouse.  
The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  
The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  
The lion began to be amused.  
The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  
Opportunity arrived.  
A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  
The lion entangled himself in the net.  
The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  
The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  
The mouse ran to the lion.  
The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  
The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  
The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.

"	"A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."""
"An oven broke because the broiler of the oven activated.  
The oven scorched a group of treats and created some fire.  
The husband of a narrator who owned a house and owned the oven attempted for the husband of the narrator to retrieve the group of treats and discovered that the oven had created the fire.  
The husband of the narrator unsuccessfully tried to eliminate the fire.  
The husband of the narrator quickly shut the door of the oven in order to prevent the fire spreading.  
The narrator retrieved a fire extinguisher.  
The husband of the narrator opened the door of the oven.  
The fire ascended to the ceiling of the house.  
The oven began to be broken, and the fire extinguisher eliminated the fire.  
The fire didn't damage the group of things of the house.  
The house aired, and the husband of the narrator and the narrator cleaned the house in order for the house to be normal.  
The husband of the narrator and the narrator used some griddle and used a toaster oven.  
The narrator ordered a new second oven.  
The narrator began to be excited because she had ordered the second oven.

"	Woohoo!! So excited about my new range I ordered a few days ago. Seriously, I can hardly wait. A couple of weeks ago we had a fire in our old oven/range. The oven malfunctioned... it was supposed to be baking at 350 degrees but somehow broiler came on and got stuck??... my husband went to get a batch of cookies and found them in flames. He tried to put the fire out unsuccessfully and then quickly shut the door to keep the fire from spreading. I ran and got a fire extinguisher. He opened the oven door and the flames shot all the way up to the ceiling!!! Luckily the fire extinguisher worked but our stove was toast. Nothing got damaged besides the range but it took days of airing the house out and cleaning before things were 100% back to normal. Since then we have been using a plug-in burner, griddle, and counter top oven. Not exactly the most convenient but so much better than nothing!! Can't wait to have a real range again.
"An oven broke because the broiler of the oven activated.  
The oven scorched a group of treats and created some fire.  
The husband of a narrator who owned a house and owned the oven attempted for the husband of the narrator to retrieve the group of treats and discovered that the oven had created the fire.  
The husband of the narrator unsuccessfully tried to eliminate the fire.  
The husband of the narrator quickly shut the door of the oven in order to prevent the fire spreading.  
The narrator retrieved a fire extinguisher.  
The husband of the narrator opened the door of the oven.  
The fire ascended to the ceiling of the house.  
The oven began to be broken, and the fire extinguisher eliminated the fire.  
The fire didn't damage the group of things of the house.  
The house aired, and the husband of the narrator and the narrator cleaned the house in order for the house to be normal.  
The husband of the narrator and the narrator used some griddle and used a toaster oven.  
The narrator ordered a new second oven.  
The narrator began to be excited because she had ordered the second oven.

"	Woohoo!! So excited about my new range I ordered a few days ago. Seriously, I can hardly wait. A couple of weeks ago we had a fire in our old oven/range. The oven malfunctioned... it was supposed to be baking at 350 degrees but somehow broiler came on and got stuck??... my husband went to get a batch of cookies and found them in flames. He tried to put the fire out unsuccessfully and then quickly shut the door to keep the fire from spreading. I ran and got a fire extinguisher. He opened the oven door and the flames shot all the way up to the ceiling!!! Luckily the fire extinguisher worked but our stove was toast. Nothing got damaged besides the range but it took days of airing the house out and cleaning before things were 100% back to normal. Since then we have been using a plug-in burner, griddle, and counter top oven. Not exactly the most convenient but so much better than nothing!! Can't wait to have a real range again.
"An oven broke because the broiler of the oven activated.  
The oven scorched a group of treats and created some fire.

"	Woohoo!! So excited about my new range I ordered a few days ago. Seriously, I can hardly wait. A couple of weeks ago we had a fire in our old oven/range. The oven malfunctioned... it was supposed to be baking at 350 degrees but somehow broiler came on and got stuck??... my husband went to get a batch of cookies and found them in flames. He tried to put the fire out unsuccessfully and then quickly shut the door to keep the fire from spreading. I ran and got a fire extinguisher. He opened the oven door and the flames shot all the way up to the ceiling!!! Luckily the fire extinguisher worked but our stove was toast. Nothing got damaged besides the range but it took days of airing the house out and cleaning before things were 100% back to normal. Since then we have been using a plug-in burner, griddle, and counter top oven. Not exactly the most convenient but so much better than nothing!! Can't wait to have a real range again.
"An oven broke because the broiler of the oven activated.  
The oven scorched a group of treats and created some fire.  
The husband of a narrator who owned a house and owned the oven attempted for the husband of the narrator to retrieve the group of treats and discovered that the oven had created the fire.  
The husband of the narrator unsuccessfully tried to eliminate the fire.  
The husband of the narrator quickly shut the door of the oven in order to prevent the fire spreading.  
The narrator retrieved a fire extinguisher.  
The husband of the narrator opened the door of the oven.  
The fire ascended to the ceiling of the house.  
The oven began to be broken, and the fire extinguisher eliminated the fire.  
The fire didn't damage the group of things of the house.  
The house aired, and the husband of the narrator and the narrator cleaned the house in order for the house to be normal.  
The husband of the narrator and the narrator used some griddle and used a toaster oven.  
The narrator ordered a new second oven.  
The narrator began to be excited because she had ordered the second oven.

"	Woohoo!! So excited about my new range I ordered a few days ago. Seriously, I can hardly wait. A couple of weeks ago we had a fire in our old oven/range. The oven malfunctioned... it was supposed to be baking at 350 degrees but somehow broiler came on and got stuck??... my husband went to get a batch of cookies and found them in flames. He tried to put the fire out unsuccessfully and then quickly shut the door to keep the fire from spreading. I ran and got a fire extinguisher. He opened the oven door and the flames shot all the way up to the ceiling!!! Luckily the fire extinguisher worked but our stove was toast. Nothing got damaged besides the range but it took days of airing the house out and cleaning before things were 100% back to normal. Since then we have been using a plug-in burner, griddle, and counter top oven. Not exactly the most convenient but so much better than nothing!! Can't wait to have a real range again.
"An oven broke because the broiler of the oven activated.  
The oven scorched a group of treats and created some fire.  
The husband of a narrator who owned a house and owned the oven attempted for the husband of the narrator to retrieve the group of treats and discovered that the oven had created the fire.  
The husband of the narrator unsuccessfully tried to eliminate the fire.  
The husband of the narrator quickly shut the door of the oven in order to prevent the fire spreading.  
The narrator retrieved a fire extinguisher.  
The husband of the narrator opened the door of the oven.  
The fire ascended to the ceiling of the house.  
The oven began to be broken, and the fire extinguisher eliminated the fire.  
The fire didn't damage the group of things of the house.  
The house aired, and the husband of the narrator and the narrator cleaned the house in order for the house to be normal.  
The husband of the narrator and the narrator used some griddle and used a toaster oven.  
The narrator ordered a new second oven.  
The narrator began to be excited because she had ordered the second oven.

"	Woohoo!! So excited about my new range I ordered a few days ago. Seriously, I can hardly wait. A couple of weeks ago we had a fire in our old oven/range. The oven malfunctioned... it was supposed to be baking at 350 degrees but somehow broiler came on and got stuck??... my husband went to get a batch of cookies and found them in flames. He tried to put the fire out unsuccessfully and then quickly shut the door to keep the fire from spreading. I ran and got a fire extinguisher. He opened the oven door and the flames shot all the way up to the ceiling!!! Luckily the fire extinguisher worked but our stove was toast. Nothing got damaged besides the range but it took days of airing the house out and cleaning before things were 100% back to normal. Since then we have been using a plug-in burner, griddle, and counter top oven. Not exactly the most convenient but so much better than nothing!! Can't wait to have a real range again.
